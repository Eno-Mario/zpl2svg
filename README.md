# This is a vanilla JS implementation of a ZPL (Zebra Programming Language) to SVG converter.
# It is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

# The goal is to be able to convert from ZPL to SVG and vice verse. 
# There are still a lot of bugs and missing features, but it is a start.

# To try it out, you can run the following command to host a local instance:
```bash
npx serve .
```
